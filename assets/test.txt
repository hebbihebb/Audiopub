The chisel's impression on my cheek feels too real for any game.

I wake with drool connecting my mouth to a half-carved piece of driftglass, the ornamental kind that sells for absurd amounts to collectors who don't know better. My neck aches—a dull, persistent throb that spreads down into my shoulders. I've fallen asleep at my workbench before, plenty of times, but the VR rig's neural interface usually prevents this kind of physical feedback.

I sit up, and the world tilts slightly before righting itself.

Everything is exactly where I left it. The rack of chisels arranged by size and purpose. The sewing corner with its three machines. My alchemy station, organized with the kind of precision that would make a laboratory technician weep. The forge, cold now, but I can still smell the tang of hot metal and quenching oil.

It all looks right. Feels right.

Too right.

I touch the workbench—honest oak, the grain running true. The wood is warm under my palm, and I can feel every whorl and knot. The texture where I'd sanded it smooth years ago. The weight of the air itself feels different. Substantial. Like the difference between looking at a photograph and standing in the actual place.

"Okay," I say aloud, and my voice sounds wrong. Clearer than it should be. "Okay, Riven. You fell asleep logged in. Again."

I look down at my hands.

They're wrong.

Not wrong wrong—they respond when I flex my fingers. But they're not my hands. These are longer, more elegant, the nails perfectly maintained. Pale as porcelain, almost translucent. There's a callus on my right index finger from holding needles, another on my left palm from chisel work, but they're in slightly different places than they should be.

These are Ashmark's hands. My avatar's hands.

I stand too quickly, and the workshop spins. I'm taller than I should be—not by much, maybe three inches, but enough that my center of gravity feels wrong. I look down at myself and see the work clothes I logged out in: leather apron over a simple linen shirt and canvas pants, all stained with substances from a dozen different crafts.

The sensory input is overwhelming. I can smell everything: cedar shavings, mineral oil, quenching salts, the mustiness of leather scraps. The air tastes like metal and wood and something organic and alive that VR has never replicated.

"This is a dream," I tell the empty workshop. "Just a really vivid dream."

The workshop doesn't answer. It never has. I've always liked that about this place—no NPCs, no quest markers. Just tools and materials and the quiet satisfaction of making things.

I walk to the far wall where my masterwork tools hang. Twelve sets, one for each Life Craft I've maxed over twelve years of playing. I reach for the Woodshaper's adze.

My hand trembles as I lift it from its hook. The weight is wrong—not heavy or light, but different. In the game, weight was a number that affected stamina drain. This weight is real. I can feel how the head wants to swing forward, how the handle fits my grip.

The wood of the handle is smooth from use, with a slight groove worn by my thumb over thousands of hours. I run my finger along it, and the sensation makes my breath catch.

"[Status]," I say, because muscle memory is hard to break.

A translucent blue window materializes in front of me.
