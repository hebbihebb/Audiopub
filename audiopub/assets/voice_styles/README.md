# Voice Styles

- `F1.json`: current female voice (soft blend toward deeper tone).
- `F1_deep_female.json`: saved deeper-yet-female blend.
- `F1.json.bak`: original untouched F1 style.
- `M1.json`, `M2.json`, `F2.json`: provided base voices.

Notes:
- Blends are interpolations between original F1 and M1 to reduce vocal fry while keeping a feminine timbre.
- Update metadata `modified` in the JSON to track custom tweaks.
